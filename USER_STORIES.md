## 3. Use Cases

### UC-01: Manage Projects

**Actor**: Solo User, Team Owner  
**Precondition**: User is authenticated and on the dashboard  
**Trigger**: User clicks "New Project" or interacts with existing project cards

**Main Flow**:
1. User views the Project Dashboard with all existing projects displayed as cards.
2. User clicks "+ Create" to open the Create Project modal.
3. User fills in project name, description, selects an icon and accent color.
4. User chooses project mode (Solo or Team).
5. If Team mode, user adds team members via email and assigns roles.
6. User clicks "Create Project" — project appears on the dashboard.
7. User can later edit project settings, manage tags, or delete the project.

**Postcondition**: Project is persisted and visible on the dashboard and in analytics.  
**Constraints**: Maximum 4 total projects (solo + team combined). Maximum 5 members per team project.

---

### UC-02: Execute Daily Task Management

**Actor**: Solo User, Team Editor, Team Owner  
**Precondition**: User has selected a project and is viewing the workspace  
**Trigger**: User interacts with the 7-day rolling task board

**Main Flow**:
1. User views the current week (Mon–Sun) laid out as vertical day columns.
2. User creates a new task via the Quick Add input at the bottom of a day column.
3. User drags tasks to reorder within a day or moves them across days.
4. User clicks a task to open the Task Drawer with full details.
5. User adds sub-tasks, sets priority, assigns due dates, and tags.
6. User marks tasks as complete via the toggle button.
7. User clicks "Rollover" to move uncompleted past tasks to today.

**Postcondition**: Task state is persisted and reflected across all views (timeline, analytics, progress cards).

---

### UC-03: Execute Focus Session

**Actor**: Solo User, Team Editor, Team Owner  
**Precondition**: User has at least one task in the current project  
**Trigger**: User clicks the timer icon on a task card or in the Task Drawer

**Main Flow**:
1. User opens the Focus Timer widget (floating, draggable).
2. User selects a productivity method: Pomodoro (25/5), 52/17 Rule, or 90-Minute Flow.
3. User begins a focus session — the circular progress ring animates.
4. Timer changes color as time runs low (primary → amber → rose).
5. When the session completes, a browser notification and audio chime alert the user.
6. User may switch to a break mode (short or long) between focus sessions.
7. User can minimize the timer to a compact pill or close it entirely.

**Postcondition**: Completed sessions are counted and persisted. Timer state survives page refresh.

2. User adds a new member by entering their email and selecting a role.
3. System sends an invite (pending state) — the member appears in the list.
4. Owner can change member roles or remove members (except themselves).
5. Admin can manage members but cannot delete the project or remove the owner.
6. Editors see only their assigned tasks and can only toggle task status.

**Postcondition**: RBAC rules are enforced. Audit log entries are created for all membership changes.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria (Major Epics)

### EP-03: Chronos Timeline

| AC ID | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|
| **AC-03.1** | **GIVEN** a user is viewing a project workspace, **WHEN** the Chronos Timeline renders, **THEN** it displays a horizontally scrollable strip of all weeks in the project's estimated duration, with the current week highlighted and centered. |
| **AC-03.2** | **GIVEN** the timeline is visible, **WHEN** the user clicks a week pill, **THEN** the active week label animates to the selected week number, and the timeline strip springs to center that week. |
| **AC-03.3** | **GIVEN** the user has scrolled to a past or future week, **WHEN** they click the "Jump to Current Week" button, **THEN** the timeline smoothly scrolls back and highlights the current week. |

### EP-04: Advanced Focus Timer

| AC ID | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|
| **AC-04.1** | **GIVEN** a task exists in the Daily Focused View, **WHEN** the user clicks the timer icon in the Task Drawer, **THEN** the Focus Timer opens as a draggable floating widget, pre-bound to that task's title, with the selected productivity method's default durations. |
| **AC-04.2** | **GIVEN** the Focus Timer is running, **WHEN** the user refreshes or navigates away and returns, **THEN** the timer restores its previous state (remaining time, mode, method, task title) from `localStorage` and resumes correctly. |
| **AC-04.3** | **GIVEN** a focus session completes (timeLeft reaches 0), **WHEN** the timer fires, **THEN** a browser notification is displayed (if permissions granted), an audio chime plays via `AudioContext`, the timer status changes to "idle", and the progress ring resets to full for the next session. |

### EP-07: Enterprise Audit Log (Activity Trail)

| AC ID | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|
| **AC-07.1** | **GIVEN** a user with `owner` or `admin` role opens Project Settings and navigates to the Activity Log tab, **WHEN** the tab renders, **THEN** all logged actions are displayed in reverse-chronological order with human-readable descriptions, performer email, and relative timestamps. |
| **AC-07.2** | **GIVEN** any mutation occurs (project update, member addition/removal, note creation, settings change), **WHEN** the mutation completes, **THEN** a new audit log entry is automatically appended without any manual instrumentation by the developer. |
| **AC-07.3** | **GIVEN** a user with `editor` role navigates to the Activity Log tab, **WHEN** the tab renders, **THEN** they see a "Restricted Access" lock screen with an informational message instead of the log entries, and no audit data is exposed. |

## 6. Non-Functional Stories

| ID | Story | Category |
|---|---|---|
| **NF-01** | As a user, I want all animations to run at 60fps so that the UI feels smooth and responsive. | Performance |
| **NF-02** | As a user, I want the app to work fully offline with localStorage persistence so that I can use STRIDE without an internet connection. | Reliability |
| **NF-03** | As a user, I want the UI to be fully responsive from 320px to 2560px so that I can use STRIDE on any device. | Accessibility |
| **NF-04** | As a user, I want all interactive elements to have visible focus indicators so that keyboard navigation is possible. | Accessibility |
| **NF-05** | As a user, I want the production bundle to exclude source maps and console statements so that the app is hardened. | Security |
| **NF-06** | As a user, I want all dependencies audited for known vulnerabilities so that the supply chain is secured. | Security |
| **NF-07** | As a user, I want page transitions to feel instant via React.lazy and Suspense so that navigation is seamless. | Performance |
| **NF-08** | As a user, I want expensive components memoized (React.memo) so that unnecessary re-renders don't degrade performance. | Performance |
